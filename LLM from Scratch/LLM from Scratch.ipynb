It is responsible for generating the correct input required for BERT training, which includes input tokens, masked tokens, masked token positions, segment IDs, and a label indicating whether the second sentence immediately follows the first. Let's describe each part of the function and use images to aid understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty batch and counters for positive and negative sentences. Positive sentences are pairs where the second sentence immediately follows the first, while negative sentences are pairs where this does not occur. The batch must be balanced between positive and negative sentences.\n",

    "**Masked Language Model (MLM)**: The function then randomly selects 15% of the tokens to mask for the MLM task, ensuring that `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens are not masked. These tokens are replaced by the `[MASK]` token, a random token, or remain unchanged, depending on a random draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding**: The function pads input IDs, segment IDs, masked tokens, and masked positions to ensure all lists have the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Sentence Prediction**: Finally, the function checks if the second sentence immediately follows the first. If yes, it adds a `True` label to the instance and increments the positive counter. If not, it adds a `False` label and increments the negative counter.\n",

    "This function continues generating instances until the batch is full and contains an equal number of positive and negative instances. The batch is then returned.\n",

    "The image below is a high-level description of the Transformer encoder. The input is a sequence of tokens, which are first embedded into vectors and then processed in the neural network. The output is a sequence of vectors of size H, where each vector corresponds to an input token with the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, predicting the output words requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1- Adding a classification layer on top of the encoder output.\n",
    "- 2- Multiplying the output vectors by the embedding matrix, transforming them into the vocabulary dimension.\n",
    "- 3- Calculating the probability of each word in the vocabulary with softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function in the BERT model only considers the prediction of masked values and ignores the prediction of unmasked words. As a consequence, the model converges more slowly than directional models, a characteristic compensated by its greater contextual awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the BERT training process, the model receives pairs of sentences as input and learns to predict if the second sentence in the pair is the subsequent sentence in the original document. During training, 50% of the inputs are a pair where the second sentence is the subsequent sentence in the original document, while in the other 50%, a random sentence from the corpus is chosen as the second sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the model distinguish between the two sentences during training, the input is processed as follows before entering the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1- A [CLS] token is inserted at the beginning of the first sentence, and a [SEP] token is inserted at the end of each sentence.\n",
    "- 2- A sentence embedding indicating Sentence A or Sentence B is added to each token. Sentence embeddings are similar in concept to token embeddings with a vocabulary of 2.\n",
    "- 3- A positional embedding is added to each token to indicate its position in the sequence. The concept and implementation of the positional embedding are presented in the Transformer paper.\n",
    "\n",

These scores determine how much each element of the input sequence should be attended to in producing the output representation for a given element.

    "**Embedding (self.embedding)**: Transforms the inputs (`input_ids` and `segment_ids`) into dense vectors (embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Mask (get_attn_pad_masked)**: Generates an attention mask to ignore padding tokens in the inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pooling (self.activ1(self.fc(output[:, 0]))): Applies a fully connected layer and a hyperbolic tangent activation function to the first position (the classification token) of each sequence in the encoder output. This results in a sequence representation vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classifier (self.classifier)**: A fully connected layer that generates logits for the next-sentence classification task.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Decoder (self.decoder)**: A linear layer that generates logits for the masked language modeling task. It uses the same weights as the token embedding layer for consistency in the representation space. This decoder function is used solely to generate the final logits and is not used in the model’s training process.\n",
    "\n",
